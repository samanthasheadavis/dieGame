# Dice Game
#### Week 3 Day 1 Homework

For this homework I created a simple dice game where the object is to "roll" a seven or eleven combined between two dice. I used HTML, CSS, Sass and JavaScript (mostly JavaScript).

The game is a single JavaScript object that stores:
* The start date/time of the game
* an array of the game rounds. Each round lasts until the user wins, so one round has the start time of that round plus the number of rolls of the dice that have occurred for that round.
* A `rollDice` method for rolling the dice which generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays it on the dice.
* a `gameStats` method that checks to see if a seven or eleven has been rolled, calculates time elapsed, counts number of rolls and prints stats to screen once the user has won.
